2.relevant insights from the data (supported with reporting quality visualizations)


  a) The scatter plot below shown us a relationship between the item price and the sales,
  It looks like the items that cost more are the ones that make more sales.

4.Final recommendations
I recommend that we used the tuned Random Forest Model with these paramaters,although it is not the best but it's better than using default parameters.

Without Tuning the moved is a big overfit , it perfoms well only in traing data.
